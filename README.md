# Cyberpunk-Overlord-An-Unhinged-Board-Game

Dominate or be deleted. Cyberpunk Overlord is a fast-paced, chaotic, and unapologetically unfair digital board game inspired by the classic Monopoly, but rebuilt for a dystopian future. Forget buying houses; you're acquiring quantum tech hubs, blackmailing rivals, and trying not to have your consciousness corrupted by an AI revolt.

This is a fully playable, single-file web application featuring a human player vs. an AI opponent.

How to Play
The core goal is the same as always: bankrupt your opponent. However, the path to victory is paved with cybernetic treachery and reality-bending mechanics.

Core Mechanics

Acquire Assets: Land on unowned properties and buy them to build your corporate empire.

Extract Rent: When your opponent lands on your assets, they pay you rent.

Glitch & Power Play Cards: Draw cards that can instantly change your fortune, for better or worse.

Special "Unhinged" Rules

This is where the real fun begins:

Neural Sabotage: Once per game, you can hack an opponent's brain implant to swap one of their properties with one of yours. This is a great way to break up a color set and make enemies.

Rent Bomb: "Overclock" one of your properties. For the next 3 turns, its rent is doubled for opponents. But be warned: if you land on it, you pay a massive upkeep fee to the bank.

Property Weaponization: Set a "booby trap" on one of your properties. The next player to land on it pays rent and skips their next turn.

Blackout: Rolling snake eyes (double 1s) triggers a global blackout, freezing all rent payments for one full round. A perfect way to survive a trip through enemy territory.

Quantum Warp: Pay 50 Crypto Credits to instantly teleport your token to any space on the board. Use it to escape danger, or jump directly to a property you want to buy.

Moral Collapse & The AI Overlord: Committing dirty tricks like Neural Sabotage increases the "Moral Collapse" tracker. If it hits its maximum, the AI Overlord is unleashedâ€”a rogue player that moves on its own and seizes properties it lands on, locking them out of the game forever.

Future Features

This project is a solid foundation, but there's always more chaos to add. Future development could include:

Property Upgrades: Implementing the Server Racks -> Mega Server Farms -> AI Core upgrade path for massive rent increases.

Digital Cloning: Allowing players who own the AI Empire (Yellow) set to spawn a clone token that also collects rent.

Multiplayer Support: Expanding the game to support 3-4 human or AI players.

Advanced AI: Making the AI opponent smarter, with the ability to propose trades, use special mechanics, and hold a grudge.

Winning & Losing Conditions: Adding a proper bankruptcy system and a victory screen.
